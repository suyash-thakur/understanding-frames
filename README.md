# Understanding Frames in Video Processing

This project aims to provide an educational exploration of keyframes and various types of frames in video processing, shedding light on their roles and operations within the multimedia landscape.

## Keyframes

**Keyframes**, also known as I-Frames (Intra-Frames), are fundamental elements in video compression and encoding. They are complete, self-contained frames that do not rely on other frames for decoding. Keyframes serve as reference points in a video stream and are essential for maintaining video quality during compression.

In the context of this project, keyframes play a crucial role in various aspects, including:

- **Metadata Extraction**: Keyframes are often used to extract essential video metadata, such as resolution, frame rate, duration, and other relevant information.

- **Keyframe Images**: Keyframes can be used to generate representative images of a video, providing a visual summary or thumbnail of its content.


## P-Frames (Predictive Frames)

**P-Frames**, also known as Predictive Frames, are frames that rely on previous frames for decoding. They are compressed by only storing the differences between the current frame and the previous frame. P-Frames are used to reduce the size of a video stream by only storing the changes between frames.

In this project, the media file generated by running the `img_diff.js` script shows that the differences between P-Frames are often minimal.
This file generates images that show the difference between the pixels of two consecutive frames. The images are generated by comparing the pixels of the current frame with the pixels of the previous frame. Black pixels represent no change.

## B-Frames (Bidirectional Frames)

**B-Frames**, also known as Bidirectional Frames, are frames that rely on both previous and future frames for decoding. They are compressed by storing the differences between the current frame and the previous frame, as well as the differences between the current frame and the next frame. B-Frames are used to reduce the size of a video stream by only storing the changes between frames.


## How to Use the Project

This project is written in JavaScript and uses the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) library to process video files. To run the project, you will need to install FFmpeg and Node.js.

To install FFmpeg, follow the instructions on the [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

To install Node.js, follow the instructions on the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you have installed FFmpeg and Node.js, you can run the project by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run `index.js` to generate the keyframes, metadata and media file for each frames in between the keyframes.
5. Run `img_diff.js` to generate the images that show the difference between the pixels of two consecutive frames.
6. Run `create_video.js` to generate a video file from the images generated by `img_diff.js`.
